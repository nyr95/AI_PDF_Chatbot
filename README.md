# AI PDF Chatbot Fullstack

AI PDF Chatbot Fullstack is a SaaS platform designed to help users interact with and analyze PDF documents using advanced AI. It employs LangChain to parse PDFs into text, split them into manageable chunks, and create vector embeddings stored in Convex DB. Google Gemini is used to process these vectors, enabling the platform to generate intelligent, context-aware responses for user queries. With secure authentication provided by Clerk and integrated PayPal for payments, this tool offers an efficient, AI-driven way to understand and chat with PDF content.
